# In the previous exercise, you were asked to DRY up your code (remove duplicated code)
# by using Inheritance. In this exercise, you must DRY up your code 
# a different technique using Composition. Hint: Google 'Ruby Mixin Module'. (Using
# mixin modules is how you achieve Composition with Ruby.)

module SimpleCalculator

  def add(first_number, second_number)
    first_number + second_number
  end

  def subtract(first_number, second_number)
    first_number - second_number
  end

  def multiply(first_number, second_number)
    first_number * second_number
  end

  def divide(first_number, second_number)
    first_number / second_number
  end

end

  include SimpleCalculator

# Copy your driver code from the previous exercise below:

problem = FancyCalculator.new
puts problem.subtract(8, 9)
puts problem.multiply(1, 2)
puts problem.divide(8, 2)
puts problem.add(3, 10)
puts problem.square_root(9)
